 Narrative & Emotional Hook
The ad taps into individuality and shared experience — “we may not love the same flavour, but we all love the same feeling.”

 Visuals & Editing
Gen Z-coded with bold colors, fast cuts, and lifestyle aesthetics.

 Cultural Relevance
Positioned Chivita as more than juice — it’s a vibe, a feeling.

 Zyne’s Verdict:
What worked: visual storytelling, brand mood  
What missed: no CTA, could have been more interactive

 Brand Lesson:
Sell a feeling, not just a product. Make your product a part of your audience’s lifestyle.
