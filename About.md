Ad Reviews 
Welcome to the official archive of **Build & Brand with Zyne** — a twice-weekly content series by **Francess “Zyne” Ekezie**, where I break down the strategy, storytelling, and structure behind standout ads from Nigeria and beyond.

I review advertisements through the lens of a **PR strategist** and **brand storyteller**. Each review explores:

-  Narrative & emotional hook  
-  Visual design, tone & editing  
-  Cultural relevance & market impact  
-  Strategy & execution breakdown  
-  My verdict : what hit, what missed, and what brands can learn  

Whether you're a brand founder, creative, strategist, or just obsessed with great storytelling , this space helps you understand how **ads build perception, connection, and loyalty.**
 More reviews drop every **Tuesday & Friday**.
